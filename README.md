Andy Tanenbaum first released MINIX 1 in 1987 as an appendix to the book, Operating Systems: Design and Implementation.

He did a great work.

Now, Zux is an implementation of that version on a Z80 Emulator that I did, originally, for ZX Spectrum.

Fortunately, that emulator can emulate a vast kind of Z80 based computer.
